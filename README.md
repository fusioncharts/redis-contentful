A tiny library to map Contentful ‚òÅÔ∏è space into Redis ‚ö°Ô∏è

</div>

## Why should I care?

So your marketing team loves to update content without you being involved? Great! That is why you should use Contentful. But wait, there is a catch. Contentful API sometimes takes more than about `800ms`. And this is really a hit when you're having fancy SSR implemented to boost the performance of your Node JS app. As the creator of Gmail, Paul Buchheit had said "Every interaction should be faster than `100ms`. Why? Because `100ms` is the threshold where interactions feel instantaneous".

This is where redis will help you maintain the rendering speed. It's really, really fast! A few ms is all it needs to get your data. By few, we mean less than `100ms` üöÄ

`redis-contentful` maps your Contentful space's content types and their published records into your Redis server. It also maintains the schema of your Contentful space. All content types are stored in Redis as hashes. Under a particular hash, the record is stored as a key value pair with id being the record's key.

You can `sync` the data manually by calling the sync method on `redis-contentful` instance manually or you can add a webhook in Contentful by exposing an endpoint on your server which will internally call `sync`. In this way, you always have the latest content from Contentful right in your Redis.
So let's get started!

## Installation

```sh
npm install redis-contentful --save
```

## Usage

Create an instance of `redis-contentful` by passing contentful space ID & access token.

```js
import RedisContentful from 'redis-contentful';

const client = new RedisContentful({
  space: '<Space ID>',
  accessToken: '<Access Token>',
  local: 'en-GB', // This is an optional parameter, by default en-US will be used
});
```

## API

### sync

Syncs the latest space content from Contentful and dumps it in your Redis server üéâ

```js
await client.sync();
```

### get

Gets all data directly from Redis üöÄ

```js
const response = await client.get();
console.log(response);
```

You can also pass specific content type.

```js
const response = await client.get('about');
```

You'll get an object with your content type ID's as keys and their values as array of content objects.

```js
{
    "<a-key>": [{}, {}, {}],
    "<yet-another-key>": [{}, {}]
}
```

## Redis Store

> In Redis, the keys (content types) will be prefixed with redis-contentful to uniquely identify keys created by redis-contentful ü§ì
